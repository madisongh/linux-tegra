	  Choose this option if you have an SoC with integrated
	  Nvidia GPU IP.

config GK20A_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT

	int "Default timeout for submits"
	default 3000
	help
	  Default timeout for jobs in milliseconds. Set to zero for no timeout.

config GK20A_PMU

	  Select this entry to enable gk20a scaling

config GK20A_PERFMON
	bool "Use Perfmon"
	help
	  Select this to enable built-in perfmon scaling.
	  The built-in scaling option uses simplistic
	  scaling mechanism (if busy, increase frequency and
	  decrease frequency if idle).

config GK20A_DEVFREQ
	depends on TEGRA_CLK_FRAMEWORK || COMMON_CLK
	bool "Use Devfreq"
	help
	  Select this to use devfreq based scaling.
	  Devfreq is a common framework that allows using
	  variety of different governors and changing
	  between governors on the fly. By default, no
	  governor is selected.

config NVGPU_TRACK_MEM_USAGE
        bool "Track the usage of system memory in nvgpu"
	depends on GK20A
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to allow nvgpu to track and keep statistics on
	  the system memory used by the driver. This does recreate
	  some of the kmem_leak tracking but this is also applicable
	  to other OSes which do not have Linux' kmem_leak.


config GK20A_CYCLE_STATS
	bool "Support GK20A GPU CYCLE STATS"

	  Say Y here to enable the cycle stats debugging features.

config GK20A_CTXSW_TRACE
	bool "Support GK20A Context Switch tracing"
	depends on GK20A
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for the GK20A Context Switch Tracing. In this mode,
	  FECS collects timestamps for contexts loaded on GR engine. This
	  allows tracking context switches on GR engine, as well as
	  identifying processes that submitted work.

config TEGRA_GK20A
	bool "Enable the GK20A GPU on Tegra"
	depends on TEGRA_GRHOST || TEGRA_HOST1X
	depends on GK20A
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for the GK20A graphics engine on Tegra
	  by adding a Tegra platfrom interface to the GK20A driver.
	  The Tegra platform interface requires TEGRA_GRHOST (host1x).

config TEGRA_ACR
	bool "Enable HS bin support on GM20B GPU on Tegra"
	depends on GK20A_PMU
	default n
	help
	  Enable Support for Loading High Secure binary, and using
	  Write Protected Regions (WPR) for storing ucodes, and bootstrap
	  PMU, FECS and GPCCS in Low Secure mode.

config TEGRA_USE_NA_GPCPLL

	depends on TEGRA_CLK_FRAMEWORK || COMMON_CLK
	default n
	help
	  Enable noise aware (NA) mode of GM20b GPCPLL. In this mode PLL output
	  frequency is automatically adjusted when GM20b voltage is fluctuating
	  because of transient PMIC or power distribution tree noise.

config GK20A_PCI

	help
	  Enable nvgpu debug facility to redirect debug spew to ftrace. This
	  affects kernel memory use, so should not be enabled by default.

config GK20A_VIDMEM
	bool "Support separate video memory on nvgpu"
	depends on GK20A
	default n
	help
	  Enable support for using and allocating buffers in a distinct video
	  memory aperture (in contrast to general system memory), available on
	  GPUs that have their own banks. PCIe GPUs have this, for example.
