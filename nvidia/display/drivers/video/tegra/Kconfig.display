	depends on TEGRA_DC && !TEGRA_NVDISPLAY
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to enable Tegra color management unit.

	bool "Tegra Color Management Unit(Version 2)"
	depends on TEGRA_DC && TEGRA_NVDISPLAY
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to enable Tegra color management unit.
	  Enabled by default to support color correction for panels.
	  It is used to make the representation of color match
	  across displays.

config TEGRA_NVDISPLAY
        bool "Tegra NvDisplay Architecture Support"
	depends on TEGRA_DC
	help
	    Enable the support for NvDisplay Architecture
	    If unsure, say N

config TEGRA_DC_CDE
	bool "Tegra Color Decompression Engine"
	depends on TEGRA_DC && (ARCH_TEGRA_210_SOC || TEGRA_NVDISPLAY)
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to enable Tegra color decompression engine
	  Enabled by default to support compressed framebuffer.
	  It is used to save bandwidth on memory request with surfaces created
	  by graphics. The amount of memory required for a surface is the same,
	  but compression bit tags are used to indicate if a block contains
	  infomation on a larger number of pixels.

config TEGRA_DC_SCAN_COLUMN
	bool
	depends on TEGRA_DC
	default y
	help
	  Enables access to scan column mode for providing 90 and 270 rotation.
	  The pixel format for a surface using scancolumn must be encoding
	  using BlockLinear.
	  Failure to use proper pixel format will result in EINVAL errors.

config TEGRA_DC_BLENDER_GEN2
	bool
	depends on TEGRA_DC
	default y

config TEGRA_DC_BLENDER_DEPTH
	bool "Program blender depth for overlays"
	depends on TEGRA_DC
	default y
	help
	  This option is required for chips that support it.
	  Disabling this means multiple windows will not be blended correctly.
	  This may be acceptable in situations where windows never overlap or
	  if there is there are no overlays and only base.

config TEGRA_DC_BLOCK_LINEAR
	bool "Support Block Linear encoding"
	depends on TEGRA_DC
	default y
	help
	  A swizzled format that makes vertical walks of a surface
	  consume less bandwidth than a traditional pitched linear
	  pixel format.
	  This needs to be enabled on chips that support it.

config TEGRA_DC_INTERLACE
	bool
	depends on TEGRA_DC
	default y
	help
	  Support output in interlaced formats on chips that support it.
	  This requires that a carefully constructed set of surfaces are
	  used that match the needs of the interlaced mode.
	  With this enabled HDMI 1080i is possible. But 480i is not, due
	  to the lack of pixel doubling support.

	depends on TEGRA_DC && !TEGRA_NVDISPLAY
	default y
	help
	  LUT support for Tegra display controller.
	  This will only be enabled for chips which support
	  8bits per color and have separate hardware registers
	  to write those palette values.

config TEGRA_LUT_V2
	bool "Tegra Look Up Table (version 2)"
	depends on TEGRA_DC && TEGRA_NVDISPLAY
	default y
	help
	  LUT support for Tegra display controller.
	  This will only be enabled for chips which can support
	  16bits per color. Hardware has only register to

	  Say Y here to support HDCP upstream and downstream protocols for HDMI2_0,
	  this requires a correctly fused chip to negotiate keys.
	  It is only needed if you have an application that cares about checking
	  for HDCP security while playing protected content. You do not need this
	  option to simply display a GUI on an HDMI TV. An HDMI TV will display
	  unprotected content just fine.

config TEGRA_DEBUG_HDCP
	bool "Support Debug mode for HDCP on HDMI2_0"
	depends on TEGRA_HDMIHDCP

	help
	  Display driver parses all the YUV modes specified in EDID of a given sink.
	  But T210 does not have hardware support for any of the YUV modes and T186 hardware
	  supports only YUV422 and YUV444 modes. Say Y here to filter out all YUV modes on
	  T210 platforms and to filter out YUV420 modes on T186 platforms. These modes will
	  not be exposed to upper layers, including userspace.
