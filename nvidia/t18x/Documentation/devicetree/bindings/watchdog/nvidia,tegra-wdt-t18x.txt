* NVIDIA Tegra18x Watchdog controller

Required properties:

- compatible: Should be "nvidia,tegra-wdt-t18x"
- reg: Should contain WDT and corresponding timer source
  registers location and length.

Optional properties for recovery mode:

- interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu
- nvidia,wdt-cluster-id: ID of the cpu cluster monitored by this WDT instance.
- nvidia,enable-on-init: toggle switch for enable during init
- nvidia,heartbeat-init: default timeout in secs (120 secs if not specified)
- nvidia,shutdown-timeout: timeout in secs during shutdown before watchdog
			reset occurs. same as heartbeat if not specified.
- nvidia,expiry-count: total expiration levels supported by the watchdog.
       Should be 1 if not specified.
- nvidia,extend-watchdog-suspend: Boolean. Extend the disable of watchdog
	timer to syscore suspend and re-eanble on syscore resume. If this
	is selected then do not disable watchdog timer in device suspend
	otherwise disable in device suspend.

Optional properties for debug purpose:

- nvidia,disable-debug-reset:
	Disable system wide debug reset assertion at fourth expiration of the
	counter. WDT debug reset can be intercepted by debug logic, e.g. to
	preserve information. This reset should be enabled if not specified.
- nvidia,disable-por-reset:
	Disable internal full system reset at fifth expiration of the counter.
	WDT POR reset cannot be intercepted and acts as a Power On Reset. This
	reset should be enabled if not specified.

Examples:

watchdog@30c0000 {
       compatible = "nvidia,tegra-wdt-18x";
       reg = <0x0 0x030c0000 0x0 0x10000
              0x0 0x03090000 0x0 0x10000>;
       nvidia,expiry-count = <5>;
       status = "disabled";
};

watchdog@30d0000 {
       compatible = "nvidia,tegra-wdt-18x";
       reg = <0x0 0x030c0000 0x0 0x10000
              0x0 0x030a0000 0x0 0x10000>;
       nvidia,expiry-count = <5>;
       status = "disabled";
};
