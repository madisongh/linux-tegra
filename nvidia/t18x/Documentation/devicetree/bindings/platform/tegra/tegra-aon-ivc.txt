NVIDIA Tegra SPE/AON aux CPU, with communication via the "IVC" IPC protocol.

AON is an aux CPU which communicates with CCPLEX over IVC.

The AON FW implements IVC, and uses HSP DB IRQs as part of IVC. The
AON FW expects AST regions 0/1 are already set up for the AON to
access SYSRAM and GSC carveout in DRAM. It configures the AST region 2
to point at DRAM IVC carveout upon receving the carveout address and
size from CCPLEX.
 * Carveout address: SMMU IOVA of the IPC region
 * Slave address: Some hard coded location that SPE FW knows. Ex: 0x80000000?

== AON top-level node ==

The AON core is represented by the top-level node.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "nvidia,tegra186-aon" for T18x.
- nvidia,hsp-notifications: <HSP-phandle HSP-ID HSP-DB>
  * HSP is a set of HW synchronization primitives used in Tegra to allow
    multiple processors to share resources and communicate together.
  * HSP-ID is NVIDIA Tegra HSP unique source ID for AON, used in IPC.
  * HSP-DB is NVIDIA Tegra HSP unique doorbell number allotted to AON.
    A HSP doorbell allows a set of source agents in Tegra to request the
    attention of specified target agent. In general the agents are processors
    and doorbell used as part of an IPC protocol.
  * For more HSP details, refer: ./tegra-hsp.txt.
- reg: Address entries (AON shared mailbox, AON shared semaphore)
  Formatted as per standard rules for this property.

Mailbox properties:
- #mbox-cells
  Should be set to <1>.
The IVC channels are represented as mailbox channels.
Hence, this binding makes use of the mailbox binding at ../../mailbox/mailbox.txt.

SMMU properties:
- #stream-id-cells
  Should be set to <1>.
This property is used to configure the SMMU to SPE IVC carveout in DRAM.

== AON sub nodes ==

* ivc-channels
Contains a sub-node for each IVC channel implemented by the AON.
For IVC channel details, please refer: ./tegra-ivc-channel.txt

Possible example:

aon: aon@c160000 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-aon";
	reg = <0x0 0x0c160000 0x0 0x10000>, /* AON shared mailbox */
		<0x0 0x0c1a0000 0x0 0x20000>; /* AON shared semaphore */
	nvidia,hsp-notifications = <&hsp_top
				TEGRA_HSP_PROC_SPE
				TEGRA_HSP_DB_SPE>;
	#mbox-cells = <1>;
	#stream-id-cells = <1>;
	ivc-channels@80000000 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		ivc_aon_echo@0 {
			reg = <0x0000>, <0x1000>;
			reg-names = "rx", "tx";
			nvidia,frame-count = <16>;
			nvidia,frame-size = <64>;
		};
		ivc_aon_aondbg@480 {
			reg = <0x0480>, <0x1480>;
			reg-names = "rx", "tx";
			nvidia,frame-count = <2>;
			nvidia,frame-size = <128>;
		};
	};
};
