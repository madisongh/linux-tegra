config TEGRA_CENTRAL_ACTMON
	bool "Tegra Activity Monitor"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA
	default n
	help
	  Actmon is a hardware block that can be used to track the activity of
	  certain hardware units. It can boost EMC clock depending
	  on the memory trafic among various client. It is called central actmon
	  as it monitors central activity for example MC activity. HW fabric of
	  central and unit actmon is different. If unsure, say Y here.

	help
	  When enabled, drivers for ISO units can obtain ISO BW.
	  The memory controller (MC) for each Tegra platform can supply
	  a limited amount of isochronous (real-time) bandwidth.  When
	  enabled, isomgr will manage a pool of ISO BW.

	  In the Common Clock Framework (starting T18x), platform drivers can
	  use DTB to acsess clocks. Mods clock driver needs to insert 'mods'
	  node in live dtb at driver initialisation and add all clocks that it
	  needs to that node. The 2 OF_ configs help to do that.
