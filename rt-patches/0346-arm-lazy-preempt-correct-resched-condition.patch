Subject: [PATCH 346/351] arm: lazy preempt: correct resched condition
X-NVConfidentiality: public

If we get out of preempt_schedule_irq() then we check for NEED_RESCHED
and call the former function again if set because the preemption counter
has be zero at this point.
However the counter for lazy-preempt might not be zero therefore we have
to check the counter before looking at the need_resched_lazy flag.
