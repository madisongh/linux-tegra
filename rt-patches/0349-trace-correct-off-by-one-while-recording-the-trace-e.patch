Subject: [PATCH 349/366] trace: correct off by one while recording the
 trace-event

Trace events like raw_syscalls show always a preempt code of one. The
reason is that on PREEMPT kernels rcu_read_lock_sched_notrace()
increases the preemption counter and the function recording the counter
is caller within the RCU section.
